# The Dotcom Thing

The Dotcom Thing is a chrome extension that injects code into any website ending in .com, which may or may not make the website unusable.

## How do I install it if it isn't on the chrome webstore?

**This will only work if you use chrome**

You will need to download the source code [here](https://github.com/ljp-projects/thedotcomthing) and go to 'chrome://extensions'. Then toggle 'Developer mode' to on. Then press 'Load Unpacked'. Locate the source code for the extension. And then voila! It has been installed.
